## Deque

## Monotonic Queue

A monotonic queue is a double-ended queue that **can only be inserted at the end of the queue but can be deleted at both ends.** The element value stored in the monotonic queue is monotonous (either monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing) from the head of the queue to the tail of the queue.
