## Guide
Some experiences of cracking leetcode

## Create List

1. Solve problems by tags and make your template.

2. Create a `must list` for yourself

## Take notes

Try to use different strategies to solve the same problem, like `Bruce force` and `Advanced algorithms`

## Review strategy
It's not about how much you can `learn`, it's about how much you can `remember`

|Legend|Description|
|--|--|
|y| solved with ease|
|?| solved after many trials|
|*| Tried multiple times and still couldn't figure out|

Try to use a table to record the time for solving the problem(You have to make sure to have enough time when having an interview).

|Problem|difficulty|Solved time(in minutes)|

### Anki
Please do not try to copy and paste a large chunk of code into `Anki`, it won't work. try `information compression` and add some useful tips that can help you remind of what you have learned.
