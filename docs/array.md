# Array

## Definition of Array

In many programming languages, arrays are **fixed in length**, so it is hard to add new data when the last element of the array is reached. Adding and removing data from an array is also difficult because you have to move array elements up or down to reflect either an addition or a deletion. However, these problems do not come up with JavaScript arrays, since we can use the split() function without having to perform additional array element accesses.

**The main problem with using JavaScript arrays, however, is that arrays in JavaScript are implemented as objects, causing them to be less efficient than arrays built in languages such as C++ and Java**
